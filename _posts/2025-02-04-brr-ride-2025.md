Moving back to Iowa has presented some interesting new opportunities for my bicycling experiences. My first event ride of 2025 was to attend the 48th Annual Bike Ride to Rippey or BRR. Not necessarily a long ride, 12 miles from Perry, Iowa to Rippey, Iowa and then 12 miles back to Perry. The real mystique of BRR is that it happens the first Saturday in February - no matter how cold, windy, icy, snowy. or rainy!

My first challenege was to be sure I had all the appropriate cold weather riding gear for the day. After registering for the ride, I contacted my old roommate from college, Jim, to see if he was riding it this year. Jim was registered to ride BRR this year and invited me to ride with him, his son-in-law, Ben, and grandson, Ross. I asked Jim for some advice about riding clothing and gear and what type of bikes they would be riding.

I felt I had most of the cold weather clothing that I needed but Jim emphasized having my feet, hands, and face well covered. So I decided to get some winter cycling shoes, Bar Mitts for my handlebars, and some new under helmet hear wear. Jim and teh others would be on fat bikes so I chose to ride my fattest tired mountain bike.

I drove down to Jim's place the day before BRR and spent the night. His daughter drove us all to Perry on the morning of the ride to drop us off. We arrived at 8:45 am for a 10 am group start. We had plenty of time to eat at the optional pancake breakfast in the Hotel Pattee - official host hotel and starting line area for BRR. We brought overnight clothing in duffels with us so we could stay overnight at the [Hotel Pattee](https://www.hotelpattee.com/) after the ride and then ride back to Jim's house on Sunday.

About 600 riders were on hand as we started out the first 12 mile leg of our ride to Rippey. The temperature was arounf 34 degrees with a wind that was blowing at over 20 - 25 mph from the southeast. So we rode with a strong tailwind the first 12 miles to Rippey with ease, even though the wind chill was in the 20's. Half-way between Perry and Rippey there is a farm that has a bonfire, beer trailer, and a food truck. I was surprised at how many were stopped at the 6 mile point to partake in food and drink. This would also be a stop for many on the way back to Perry.

We arrived in Rippey fairly quickly, thanks to a wonderful tailwind. Rippey is only about 220 people in population, so adding over 500 people to the downtown made for a very party-like atmosphere. I used my free beer coupon to snag a nice Potosi summer shandy on a really cold winters day. We retreated to the warmth on the local Methodist Church for a bowl of chili and a slice of pie. The chili was very good and my cherry pie was a perfect compliment - now to head back to Perry in a unrelenting headwind.

Fortunately I had gotten in a few rides outdoors in January and some indoor riding so I wasn't totally out of riding shape. It paid off for me as I was able to fight the wind at a decent pace. I was lucky to find another rider that was riding a similar pace and able to trade off pulls to get back to Perry more quickly. Unfortunately I had left Jim and Ross way behind so after arriving back to Perry and exploring the downtown - I rode back about 4 miles to find Jim and Ross to ride back in with them.

Once we were all back in Perry we retreated for more food and drink at the Tin Pig. We also had one coupon each for a free 6 ounce craft beer pour from the Tin Pig's brewery. The Tin Pig was packed with cyclists as were many of the local bars and restaurants. When we finished at the Tin Pig our room was ready at the Hotel Pattee.

The rooms at the Hotel Pattee are themed and we scored the Alley Oop room, based on the comic strip [Alley Oop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alley_Oop). The Alley Oop creator, Vincent Trout Hamlin, was from Perry, Iowa. The rooms at the Hotel Pattee are very spacious and have very nice amenities. Ours also had a huge walk-in shower and a seperate spa/jacuzzi tub.
