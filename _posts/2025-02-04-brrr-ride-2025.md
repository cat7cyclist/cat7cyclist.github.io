Moving back to Iowa after 44 years has presented some interesting new opportunities. My first paid ride of 2025 was to attend the 48th Annual Bike Ride to Rippey or BRR. Not necessarily a long ride, 12 miles from Perry, Iowa to Rippey, Iowa and then 12 miles back to Perry. The real mystique of BRR is that it happens the first Saturday in February - no matter how cold, windy, icy, snowy. or rainy!

My first challenege was to be sure I had all the appropriate cold weather riding gear for the day. After registering for the ride, I contacted my old roommate from college, Jim, to see if he was riding it this year. Jim was indeed riding BRR this year and invited me to ride with him, his son-in-law, Ben, and grandson, Ross. I asked Jim for some advice about riding clothing and gear and what type of bikes they would be riding.
